**Hi!** I am a 1st year Master's student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. Peter Bradley Shull. I am a member of the [Wearable System Lab](https://www.wearablesystems.org/).

My current research involves motion detection algorithms based on wearable sensors, primarily focusing on golf movements.

I’m currently learning machine learning algorithms for robot control.I am particularly interested in robot manipulation based on vision-tactile sensing. I believe that dexterous manipulation is a foundational skill that robots must master early on. **My goal is to develop excellent control algorithms for dexterous hands to enable robots to integrate into all aspects of people's lives.**
