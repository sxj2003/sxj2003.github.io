**Project Overview**

This bionic butterfly was designed by our team for the 11th National Undergraduate Mechanical Innovation Design Competition to simulate the intricate flight and steering of real butterflies. We developed a compact gear-linkage transmission mechanism that efficiently converts motor rotation into wing flapping, replacing heavier traditional structures to meet strict weight and size requirements.

**Technical Achievement**

Through XFlow fluid simulation, we optimized the body angle to maximize lift and implemented a control system using a remote receiver to manage flapping frequency and steering. The project successfully transitioned from theoretical simulation to a functional physical prototype capable of wireless remote-controlled flight and basic navigation.
