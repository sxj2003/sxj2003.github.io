**Optimization Process and Strategy**

Developed for the 17th National Undergraduate Advanced Mapping Technology and Product Information Modeling Innovation Competition, our task was to achieve extreme weight reduction for a hydraulic excavator's stick using Altair Inspire. Our workflow began with motion simulation, where we built a multi-body dynamics model to capture the precise dynamic loads encountered during digging and retraction. Next, we performed topology optimization targeting "stiffness maximization," testing 14 different shape control strategies, such as symmetry and single-direction draw, to identify the most efficient material distribution.

**Structural Reconstruction and Results**

Using the PolyNURBS tool, we transformed the rough topology results into smooth, manufacturable solid models, meticulously refining curvature to eliminate irregular edges. This process led to a remarkable weight reduction, bringing the arm from an original 34.94g down to just 10.118g. Crucially, the reconstructed part maintained a minimum safety factor of 4.2, exceeding the competition requirement of 4.0 and passing all rigorous motion and strength validation tests.
